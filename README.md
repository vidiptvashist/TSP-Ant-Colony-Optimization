# TSP-Ant-Colony-Optimization
The algorithmic world is beautiful with multifarious strategies and
tools being developed round the clock to render to the need for highperformance computing. Different optimization techniques have thus
evolved based on such evolutionary algorithms and thereby opened
up the domain of metaheuristics. Metaheuristic has been derived from
two Greek words, namely, Meta meaning one level above and heuriskein
meaning to find. Algorithms such as the Particle Swarm Optimization
(PSO) and Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) are examples of swarm
intelligence and metaheuristics. The goal of swarm intelligence is to
design intelligent multi-agent systems by taking inspiration from the
collective behaviour of social insects such as ants, termites, bees, wasps,
and other animal societies such as flocks of birds or schools of fish
